# QENS_utilities
A collection of python functions that may be useful as building blocks for QENS data analysis

The file utitlities_qens.py contains a collection of small functions that may help in writing scripts for the analysis of quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) data.

These functions have been inspired by the analysis of QENS data from proteins in solution, the concept of which is explained in
M. Grimaldo et al., EPJ Web of Conferences 83, 02005 (2015) published by the European Physical Society;

Central to this approach to QENS data analysis is the description of the spectrometer energy resolution function by a sum of Gaussian functions such that this resolution function can be accounted for analytically - as opposed to a numerical convolution - when fitting a model to the observed scattering function.
